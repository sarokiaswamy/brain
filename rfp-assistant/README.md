### Enhanced Question Extraction

The system implements a "Response Guide First" approach that:

1. First generates a comprehensive response guide with all required sections
2. Uses this guide as a framework to identify ALL requirements in the RFP
3. Converts each requirement into a semantic search-optimized question
4. Creates multiple alternative phrasings for better knowledge retrieval
5. Maps each question to the specific section of the response where it should be addressed

Each extracted question includes:

- Unique ID
- Original text from the RFP document
- Search-optimized question for knowledge retrieval
- Alternative search phrasings
- Section it belongs to in the RFP
- Response section where it should be addressed
- Priority level (High/Medium/Low)
- Reference information (page numbers, section IDs)
- Relevant tags for categorization

This approach ensures that every section of the required response has corresponding searchable questions, making the RFP response process more thorough and automated.

Example:
```markdown
## Technical Requirements

### Q12: What security protocols does your solution implement?

- **Type:** requirement
- **Priority:** High
- **Reference:** Section 3.4.2
```

### Document Metadata

The `metadata.md` file contains extracted metadata like deadlines, client information, and evaluation criteria.

### Response Generation Transparency [`services/response.py`, `static/main.js`, `static/index.html`, `static/debug.css`]

The system provides comprehensive transparency into the AI response generation process:

- **Search Query Visibility**: Shows the exact search query used for retrieving knowledge
  - Implemented in `services/response.py` by including the search query in the response object
  - Displayed in the UI through `static/main.js` and styled with `static/debug.css`

- **Knowledge Source Display**: Displays all document chunks used to inform the response
  - Source documents with relevance scores are tracked in `services/response.py`
  - Rendered as an interactive table in the frontend (`static/main.js`)
  - Click handlers for source details implemented in JavaScript event listeners

- **Prompt Visibility**: Shows the exact system and user prompts used for generation
  - Prompts are loaded from templates using `utils/prompt_loader.py`
  - Both system and user prompts are preserved in the response object
  - Displayed in collapsible sections in the debug panel

- **Full Knowledge Context**: Provides the complete context given to the language model
  - The full knowledge context is preserved in `services/response.py`
  - Rendered in an expandable text area in the UI

- **Interactive Source References**: Click on any source to view the full content
  - Modal dialogs implemented in `static/main.js`
  - Source content loading and display handled via event listeners

This transparency allows users to:
- Verify which documents informed each response
- Understand how the AI interpreted the question
- Validate the accuracy of source references
- Debug and improve the knowledge base

### Vector Store Architecture [`utils/knowledge_embedder.py`, `services/knowledge.py`, `embed_knowledge.sh`]

The system features a robust knowledge management approach using Google's Gemini API:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between knowledge embedding (creation) and knowledge service (retrieval)
  - Creation handled exclusively by `utils/knowledge_embedder.py` and `embed_knowledge.sh`
  - Retrieval handled exclusively by `services/knowledge.py`

- **External Data Storage**: Vector store is maintained outside the codebase at `/Users/u1112870/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-IQVIA/Ananth/Personal/Arokia_sir/rfp-data/`
  - Path specified in `services/knowledge.py` and `embed_knowledge.sh`
  - FAISS file locations configured in the KnowledgeEmbedder class

- **Organized Data Structure**:
  - `/rfp-data/vector_store/` - Contains FAISS index and document store (index.faiss, docstore.pkl)
  - `/rfp-data/checkpoints/` - Stores processing checkpoints for resuming operations
  - `/rfp-data/logs/` - Maintains detailed logs of embedding and retrieval operations
  - `/rfp-data/source_documents/` - Optional location for source document backups

- **Robust Search Methods**: Multiple fallback mechanisms for vector similarity search 
  - Implemented in `services/knowledge.py` with progressive fallbacks
  - Primary: similarity_search_with_score
  - Secondary: similarity_search_with_relevance_scores
  - Tertiary: basic similarity_search

- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Clear error messages and logging
  - Path verification in constructor
  - Vector store existence checks
  - Detailed logging throughout embedding and retrieval

## API Endpoints

## Configuration Variables

### Hardcoded Paths

The following paths are hardcoded in the application and should be updated when porting to another environment:

1. **Vector Store Paths**:
   - In `services/knowledge.py`: `/Users/u1112870/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-IQVIA/Ananth/Personal/Arokia_sir/rfp-data/vector_store`
   - In `embed_knowledge.sh`: Source and output directory paths

2. **Document Source Paths**:
   - In `utils/knowledge_embedder.py`: Default source directory: `/Users/u1112870/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-IQVIA/Ananth/Personal/Arokia_sir/Responses`
   
3. **Output and Cache Directories**:
   - Default document output directory: `outputs/{document_id}/`
   - Default cache directory: `data/cache/`

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be set in the `.env` file to override defaults:

- `KNOWLEDGE_DIR`: Directory containing the vector store (defaults to the hardcoded path)
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Google Gemini API key (required)
- `RESPONSE_MODEL`: Gemini model to use for response generation (defaults to the model in GeminiSettings)
- `EMBEDDING_MODEL`: Gemini embedding model (defaults to model in GeminiSettings)
