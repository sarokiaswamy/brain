{"summary": "This Request for Quotation (RFQ) is issued by the IT Acquisition Center of Excellence (ACE) on behalf of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), a part of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). The core purpose of this RFQ is to establish a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for Web Agility Program Support Services (WA3). The DOT aims to procure services to support the daily operations and maintenance of its web platforms, including the Drupal Content Management System (CMS), and to facilitate the design, development, and integration of new web-based applications and content. The client seeks a solution that addresses the need for innovative, best-in-class websites and web infrastructure to support DOT's goals. The key business challenge is to maintain and enhance the DOT's digital presence, ensuring accessibility, compliance with federal standards, and a positive user experience. This RFQ is set aside for small businesses, with the FHWA anticipating awarding approximately four BPA awards. The scope includes project management, operations and maintenance, design and development, content strategy, accessibility compliance, and website analytics support. The BPA will utilize Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP), Time & Materials (T&M)/Labor Hour (LH), or hybrid contract types.", "document_identification": {"rfq_number": "693JJ325Q000011", "amendment": "5", "title": "Web Agility Program Support Services (WA3) Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT)", "date_issued": "January 16, 2025"}, "issuing_organization": {"name": "IT Acquisition Center of Excellence (ACE)", "office": "Office of Acquisition and Grants Management", "agency": "Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)", "address": "1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE, Washington, DC 20590-0001"}, "contacts": [{"name": "Soha Saifeddine", "title": "Contract Specialist", "email": "soha.saifeddine@dot.gov"}, {"name": "Christina McMurtry", "title": "Contract Specialist", "email": "Christina.McMurtry@dot.gov"}, {"name": "Gunnar Prutz", "title": "Contracting Officer", "email": "Gunnar.Prutz@dot.gov"}], "key_dates": {"technical_questions_due": {"date": "January 29, 2025", "time": "12:00 PM (Noon) Eastern Time (ET)", "method": "e-mail", "contacts": ["soha.saifeddine@dot.gov", "Christina.McMurtry@dot.gov", "Gunnar.Prutz@dot.gov"]}, "phase_i_quotations_due": {"date": "April 8, 2025", "time": "12:00 PM ET", "method": "e-mail", "contacts": ["Christina.McMurtry@dot.gov", "soha.saifeddine@dot.gov", "Gunnar.Prutz@dot.gov"]}, "bpa_period_of_performance": "72 months from the date of award, with the possibility of a 6-month extension, and orders may have a period of performance of up to two years beyond the expiration date of the BPA"}, "submission_requirements": {"format": "Electronic, compatible with Microsoft Office or Adobe Portable Document Format (.PDF)", "page_limitations": {"volume_i_phase_i_technical_quotation": {"part_i_cover_letter_and_table_of_contents": "2 pages", "part_ii_technical_approach": "6 pages", "part_iii_corporate_experience": "10 pages"}, "volume_ii_phase_ii_technical_quotation": {"part_i_cover_letter_and_table_of_contents": "2 pages", "part_ii_technical_approach": "20 pages", "part_iii_management_approach": "no page limit", "part_iv_resumes_of_key_personnel": "3 pages per resume"}, "volume_iii_phase_ii_business_quotation": {"part_i_cover_letter_and_table_of_contents": "2 pages", "part_ii_organizational_conflicts_of_interest": "no page limit", "part_iii_non_price_related_exceptions": "no page limit", "part_iv_far_52.204-25_and_far_52.204-26_telecommunication_equipment_representations": "no page limit", "part_v_tar_1252.239-71_information_technology_security_plan_and_accreditation": "no page limit", "part_vi_price_quotation_assumptions_and_basis_of_estimate": "no page limit", "part_vii_attachment_1_schedule_of_labor_rates": "no page limit"}}, "method": "Electronic submission via email", "email_limit": "Individual emails shall not exceed 25MB", "compliance_check": "A quotation which does not address all the RFQ requirements described in each RFQ Instructions section will be considered non-compliant to that requirement and may be eliminated from further consideration at the Source Selection Official\u2019s discretion."}, "evaluation_criteria": {"phase_i": {"factor_1": "Technical Approach", "factor_2": "Corporate Experience"}, "phase_ii": {"factor_3": "Technical Approach", "factor_4": "Management Approach", "factor_5": "Price"}, "basis_for_award": "Best-value decision developed from a trade-off analysis, considering the evaluation of factors from both Phase I and Phase II.
