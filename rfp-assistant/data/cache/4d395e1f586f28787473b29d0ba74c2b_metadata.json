{"summary": "This Request for Information (RFI) issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA) seeks information from vendors regarding Web Content Management System (WCMS) solutions. The SSA aims to modernize its digital presence and improve content management through a robust, user-friendly system based on the Drupal platform. The primary objective is to gather market research to inform potential budget and acquisition decisions. The SSA is looking for a comprehensive, turn-key WCMS solution, including Platform as a Service (PaaS) hosting within a FedRAMP-certified environment. The solution must support scalability, security, and compliance with federal standards, including Section 508 compliance and IPv6 compatibility. Key requirements include integration with a Content Delivery Network (CDN), support for Transport Layer Security (TLS), role-based access controls, and comprehensive reporting capabilities. The RFI emphasizes the need for a solution that can handle a high volume of web traffic and data, with an estimated 280 million site visitors per year and 55TB of object requests. The SSA is addressing the challenge of managing and delivering web content effectively and securely while ensuring accessibility and compliance with federal regulations.
