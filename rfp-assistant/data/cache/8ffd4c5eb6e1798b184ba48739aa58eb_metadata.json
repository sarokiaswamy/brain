{"summary": "This RFP, specifically Attachment 3, focuses on Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) for a government contract. The core purpose is to ensure that the selected contractor and its subcontractors can provide impartial advice and assistance to the government, maintain objectivity, and avoid any unfair competitive advantage. The client, the government, seeks to identify and mitigate any potential conflicts of interest that could compromise the integrity of the contract work. The key business challenge addressed is the risk of biased decision-making or compromised performance due to conflicting interests. The RFP requires offerors to declare whether they are aware of any actual or potential OCI. If a conflict exists, the offeror must provide detailed information and, if possible, a mitigation plan.
