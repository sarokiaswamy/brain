{"executive_summary": "This RFP requires all offerors and subcontractors to submit an Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) Statement. The primary deliverable is a signed statement declaring either the absence of any actual or potential OCI or providing detailed information about any existing conflicts. The client's primary evaluation criteria will be based on the completeness and accuracy of the OCI statement, as well as the proposed mitigation plan if a conflict is identified. Critical success factors include a thorough understanding of OCI regulations (FAR 2.101), a proactive approach to identifying potential conflicts, and a clear and concise statement. The recommended approach is to carefully review the definition of OCI, conduct a comprehensive internal assessment to identify any potential conflicts, and prepare a clear statement. If any conflicts are identified, a detailed mitigation plan should be included. The proposal team should prioritize accuracy, clarity, and compliance with all requirements outlined in Section 15.1 of the RFP (not provided in the prompt, but assumed to contain relevant OCI details).", "submission_structure": [{"section_name": "Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) Statement", "description": "A signed statement from the offeror and each subcontractor addressing potential or actual organizational conflicts of interest.", "content_requirements": ["A statement declaring either:", "1.
