{"summary": "This RFP outlines a research initiative focused on optimizing fertilizer use for improved crop yields and reduced environmental impact. The core objective is to develop a nutrient recommendation system that leverages advanced machine learning algorithms (TabNet, MLP, and XGBoost) to forecast optimal fertilizer quantities for various crops. The client aims to address the challenge of inefficient fertilizer application, which leads to nutrient loss through leaching and runoff, ultimately impacting soil fertility and potentially causing environmental damage. The proposed solution will analyze time-series data, including rainfall patterns and crop fertility, to provide farmers with tailored recommendations. This approach seeks to improve soil health, maximize crop productivity, and minimize the negative consequences of excessive fertilizer use. The project presents an opportunity to enhance agricultural practices through data-driven insights, contributing to sustainable farming and resource management. The unique aspect of this RFP lies in its application of cutting-edge machine learning techniques to address a critical agricultural challenge, offering a potentially transformative solution for fertilizer management.", "document_identification": {"title": "test.docx", "issuing_date": null, "rfp_number": null}, "issuing_organization": {"name": null, "contact": null}, "key_dates": {"submission_deadline": null, "q_and_a_period": null, "decision_timeline": null}, "submission_requirements": {"format": null, "method": null, "contact_details": null}, "evaluation_criteria": {"criteria": null, "weights": null}, "project_scope_and_background": {"background": "Fertilizer use is typically under the limited control of farmers. For the farmers to achieve higher yields and reduce fertilizer loss, competent guidance is required for the best use of these fertilizers. Additionally, there is a connection between rainfall volume and nutrient loss for various fertilizer applications after each rainfall event. Rainfall that is moderate and falls at the right moment can help nutrients penetrate the soil's rooting zone and dissolve dry fertilizer. However, too much rain can increase the possibility of runoff and the pace at which nutrients like nitrogen (N) which is quintessential, phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) which are crucial, manganese (Mn), and boron (B) that are present in the soil.", "scope": "This research presents nutrient recommendations using an updated iteration of the TabNet, MLP, and XGBoost algorithm which is based on time-series data to forecast the required quantity of nutrients for various crops by examining rainfall patterns and crop fertility. The method suggested in this study, comes in handy for improving soil fertility by providing nutrients recommendations for optimum conditions for crop growth and reducing leaching and runoff potential."}, "budget_information": null, "contract_terms_and_duration": null}
