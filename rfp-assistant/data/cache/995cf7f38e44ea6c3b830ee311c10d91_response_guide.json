{"executive_summary": "This RFP seeks a proposal for a nutrient recommendation system for various crops, leveraging time-series data, rainfall patterns, and crop fertility to optimize fertilizer use and minimize nutrient loss. The core deliverable is a system that utilizes updated iterations of TabNet, MLP, and XGBoost algorithms to forecast the required quantity of nutrients (N, P, K, Mn, B) for different crops. The client's primary evaluation criteria will likely focus on the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in predicting nutrient needs, the system's ability to reduce nutrient leaching and runoff, and the overall improvement in soil fertility. Critical success factors include demonstrating a strong understanding of the relationship between rainfall, fertilizer application, and nutrient loss, as well as showcasing the technical proficiency of the proposed algorithms. The recommended approach involves highlighting the innovative use of the specified algorithms, emphasizing the system's ability to provide precise nutrient recommendations, and clearly articulating the benefits of improved soil fertility and reduced environmental impact. The proposal should also address the practical application of the system for farmers, focusing on ease of use and the potential for increased crop yields.", "submission_structure": [{"section_name":
